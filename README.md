Project Overview

The Sustainable Edu Crowdfunding Platform leverages blockchain technology to bring transparency, automation, and global reach to fundraising for educational projects in underserved communities.It operates through smart contracts on Ethereum, ensuring security and efficiency for donors and project managers.


Objectives

Support education in disadvantaged areas via transparent, efficient fundraising
Ensure every donation is secured, traceable, and only accessible by authorized managers
Build trust between donors and project managers through automated, auditable transactions


Solution & Features

Blockchain Smart Contract:

Automates monthly fundraisers for education projects
Tracks total funds (Total Balance), donations (Donor Counter), and progress toward targets
Provides real-time transparency for all transactions

Automated Goal Management:

Smart contract checks fundraising goal after each donation
If the collection goal is reached, donations close automatically and events are triggered for completion


Roles and Responsibilities

Role

Description

Manager

Creates fundraisers, oversees withdrawal processes, has exclusive access to critical functions (like withdrawing funds).

Donors

Contribute Ether (ETH) to the campaign, increasing the donor count and campaign balance.


How It Works

**Start Fundraiser:**Manager creates a campaign smart contract with a goal amount.
Donation Process:

Donors send Ether (ETH) directly to the contract address.
Each donation updates the total balance and increments the donor count.

Goal Monitoring:

After every donation, the contract verifies if the fundraising target is met.
Upon reaching the goal, the fundraiser closes and an event signals the completion.

Withdrawing Funds:

Only the manager (project lead) can initiate fund withdrawals once the goal is reached.
Funds are transferred securely from the contract to the manager.

Auditability & Transparency:

All transactions are automatically recorded and traceable on the blockchain.
Only authorized actions are permitted by the smart contract rules.


Benefits

Automation: Streamlines the fundraising and disbursement processes
Transparency: Every contribution and transaction is visible and immutable on-chain
Security: Only the manager can access collected funds; contract rules are enforced automatically
Efficiency: Reduces delays/errors common in traditional fundraising
Trust: Donors are confident their funds support the intended educational goals
Global Reach: Donors worldwide can contribute directly, expanding the potential impact


Getting Started

Deploy the Smart Contract

Deploy on the Ethereum network using the provided smart contract code.

Connect to UI

Integrate the smart contract with the user interface (React/web app recommended).

Testing

Run thorough contract testing on testnets before going live.

First Campaign

Launch your first educational fundraising campaign!


Next Steps

Complete integration of the smart contract with the web interface.
Conduct robust test cycles.
Prepare deployment to mainnet for real-world donations.
